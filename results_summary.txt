4. Key Findings
--------------
1. The supervised CNN model significantly outperformed the GAN model in terms of AUC score
2. The supervised model trained faster and more stably
3. The supervised model achieved better validation accuracy (86.25%)
4. The GAN model showed more stable training but lower final performance

5. Future Recommendations
------------------------
1. Consider using the supervised CNN model as the primary model for this task
2. Further hyperparameter tuning could potentially improve the supervised model's performance
3. The GAN model could be used as a complementary approach for generating synthetic data
4. Consider ensemble methods combining both models for potentially better results
